RhaptosPatchTool

  This Zope Product is part of the Rhaptos system
  (http://software.cnx.rice.edu)

  RhaptosPatchTool provides a CMF tool for members to send suggested
  changes of a content object to those who have permission to edit.
  It relies on the ChangeSet object from CMFDiffTool for basic diff
  creation and application functionality.


Future plans

  - Better workflow

  - Improved patching viewing options (track changes, side-by-side)

Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from Products.RhaptosPatchTool.PatchTool import PatchTool
    >>> PatchTool.id == 'portal_patch'
    True
    >>> PatchTool.title == 'Patches'
    True
    >>> PatchTool.meta_type == 'CMF Patch Tool'
    True
    >>> from zope.interface import implementedBy
    >>> list(implementedBy(PatchTool))
    [<class 'Interface._InterfaceClass.Interface'>]
